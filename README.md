### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User visits app] --> B{Authenticated?}
    B -->|No| C[Show Landing Page]
    C --> D[Click Login/Sign Up]
    D --> E[Redirect to Auth0 Universal Login]
    E --> F[User authenticates]
    F --> G[Auth0 returns with JWT + roles]
    G --> H[Extract user role from JWT]
    H --> I{Role?}
    I -->|CAREWORKER| J[Redirect to /dashboard]
    I -->|MANAGER| K[Redirect to /manager]
    B -->|Yes| L[Check current route]
    L --> M{Valid route for role?}
    M -->|Yes| N[Show requested page]
    M -->|No| O[Redirect to default dashboard]
```

### Role Assignment Process

1. **Auth0 Setup**
   - Roles created in Auth0 Dashboard (`caretaker`, `manager`)
   - Custom Auth0 Action adds roles to JWT tokens
   - Users assigned roles manually in Auth0 User Management

2. **Frontend Processing**
   - JWT token received from Auth0 contains role information
   - `AuthContext` extracts and maps Auth0 roles to application roles:
     - `caretaker` ‚Üí `CAREWORKER`
     - `manager` ‚Üí `MANAGER`
   - Role-based routing automatically directs users to appropriate dashboards

3. **Route Protection**
   - All routes require authentication
   - Role-specific routes restrict access based on user role
   - Unauthorized access redirects to appropriate dashboard

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Auth0 account and application configured

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```env
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üîß Configuration

### Auth0 Setup Required

3. **Create Auth0 Action (Post-Login)**
   ```javascript
   exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
     const namespace = 'https://yourapp.com/';
     
     if (event.authorization) {
       const roles = event.authorization.roles || [];
       api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}roles`, roles);
       api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}roles`, roles);
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Assign Roles to Users**

```

## ü§ù Role Management

### Adding New Users

1. **Care Worker**
   - User signs up through the application
   - Admin assigns `caretaker` role in Auth0
   - User automatically gets access to care worker dashboard

2. **Manager**
   - User signs up through the application  
   - Admin assigns `manager` role in Auth0
   - User automatically gets access to management dashboard

### Role Changes
- Role changes are immediate but require user to log out and back in
- All role assignments are managed through Auth0 Dashboard
- Frontend automatically adapts to role changes on next login

## üìù Development Notes
